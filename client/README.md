## Project Name

Join The Band!

Deployed site: https://jointheband.surge.sh/

## Project Description

I would like to create an app for musicians looking to join a band or collaborate with other musicians. Musicians would be able to post on this website, and describe what kind of musician they are, and what kind of musician they are looking to work with (eg, if their band needs a bass player, or if they are a producer looking for a rapper, etc), as well as additional relevant information, such as their social media links. Some examples of similar sites include r/FindABand, [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FindABand/)(which Iâ€™ve used in the past), join-the-band.com, [(link)](https://www.join-a-band.com/) etc.
